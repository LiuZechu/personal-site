# Intro

My name's Zechu (Anglicised pronunciation: /z-uh·ch-oo/, or zéchǔ in Mandarin).
I enjoy learning new technologies, exploring exciting ideas, and solving challenging problems. I study Computer Science, and I like cool things powered by the computer, such as machine learning, networks, software engineering, and artificial intelligence. My dream is to make the world a better place through computing. Please feel free to get in touch if you would like to talk about anything.
