# Intro

My name's Zechu (Anglicised pronunciation: /zuh·choo/, or zéchǔ for Mandarin speaking folks).
I enjoy learning new technologies and exploring exciting ideas. I study Computer Science, and I like cool things powered by the computer, such as machine learning, networks, software engineering, and artificial intelligence. My (cliché but genuine) motivation is to make the world a better place through computing. Please feel free to get in touch if you would like to talk about anything.

# Currently

I'm in my 4th year of undergraduate studies in [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://nus.edu.sg/), majoring in Computer Science. I'm also part of the [University Scholars Programme (USP)](https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/), a four-year academic programme offering a diverse range of interdisciplinary modules that focus on writing and critifical thinking skills, intellectual curiosity, reflective thinking and asking questions.
