    description: 'An Agent (a virtual robot in a virtual home environment) needs to learn'
      + ' about its environment in order to respond to human questions, such as '
      + '"Where did I leave my sunglasses?", "What is the color of sofa?". '
      + 'Current methods allow the Agent to navigate the house to find the answers, '
      + 'and allow the Agent to ask additional questions to receive guidance. '
      + 'But this is insufficient. What if the Agent is free to roam around the house? '
      + 'What should it learn during such offline exploration that could help it '
      + 'respond better to questions? This project is about devising better machine '
      + 'learning techniques that exploit offline exploration. Techniques include: '
      + 'learning the co-occurrence of different household objects (e.g. the microwave '
      + 'is usually near the refrigerator rather than the bathtub), active learning '
      + 'to reduce uncertainty.',
